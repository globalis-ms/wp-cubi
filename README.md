2. Run installation command and answer the questions: `./vendor/bin/robo install`

3. Setup WordPress database: `./vendor/bin/robo wp:init`

Now you can :

* Access your site admin at `./web/wp/wp-admin`
* Use `wp-cli` commands with `./vendor/bin/wp`


## Commands

* `./vendor/bin/robo config`
* `./vendor/bin/robo install`
* `./vendor/bin/robo install:packages`
* `./vendor/bin/robo build`
* `./vendor/bin/robo build:htaccess`

## Deployment

In future releases, wp-cubi will come with pre-configured deployment tasks. For now, you can write your own deployment command, editing `./RoboFile.php`.


## WordPress plugins

wp-cubi handles WordPress plugin dependencies (including [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/) plugins) through Composer.

If you want to use plugins that are not available through [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/) or a public Composer repository, you have two options:

1. (easier) Manually add the plugin in your `./web/app/modules/` directory, then whitelist it in your `./gitignore` file
2. (recommanded) Create a [private Composer repository](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/handling-private-packages-with-satis.md) to host your plugin


## Logs

wp-cubi comes with [inpsyde/wonolog](https://github.com/inpsyde/Wonolog), which allows to log anything with a single line of code, and automatically writes logs for multiple events like PHP errors, DB errors, HTTP API errors, `wp_mail()` errors, and 404 errors.

Basic configuration is possible in wp-cubi `./config/application.php` and `./config/environments/` files, where you can change the maximum number of log files and the log level.

For advanced configuration (adding channels or handlers), you can edit `./web/app/mu-modules/00-wp-cubi-wonolog.php` (see [inpsyde/wonolog documentation](https://inpsyde.github.io/Wonolog/) and [monolog documentation](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/tree/master/doc))
